On infected WordPress sites, the following files are always present:
```
#ls -la /home/<web user>/public_html/<website>/<infected directory>
drwxr-xr-x 2 <web user> <web user>   4096 Oct 16 03:42 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 <web user> <web user>   4096 Oct 16 16:26 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 <web user> <web user>      7 Oct 16 16:42 .2d52cebe504208dd775597d6411eaf21af00f04b
-rw-r--r-- 1 <web user> <web user>     95 Oct 16 16:43 .htaccess
-rw-r--r-- 1 <web user> <web user> 204144 Oct 16 16:43 index.php
```
In this example, if the name of the infected directory is **v4A1d**, a file named **.2d52cebe504208dd775597d6411eaf21af00f04b** will be created (sha1(basename($contentPath))). 

The **index.php** contains the payload that will be sent to the client after ***gzinflate(base64_decode())***

**import.php** is the backdoor found one directory up the infected path. It is use to receive commands type 1 and 2 via POST requests.

## Command type 1
Is running every ~4 mins. Returns the content of the file ***sha1(basename($contentPath))*** encoded in base64. Example:
Content of the file:
```
{"4":7,"2":1,"0":2}
```
Returned string:
```
[RST]eyI0Ijo3LCIyIjoxLCIwIjoyfQ==[/RST]
```
## Command type 2
Is running every ~5 mins. Updates the ***.htaccess*** and the ***index.php*** files that contains the payload. Returns the status of the operation in base64. Example:
```
[RST]eyJzdGF0dXMiOi0xfQ==[/RST]
```
## Who's sending those POST queries ?
I think the clients issuing POST queries to infected WordPress are infected themselves. Anyways, here's some of the IPs observed:
* 5.39.91.110
* 83.172.132.27
* 178.128.33.106
* 173.249.16.143
* 128.199.247.176
* 37.187.20.215
* 142.93.204.172
* 162.243.158.154
* 212.68.198.234

All POST queries seen had this user agent set: **Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0**
