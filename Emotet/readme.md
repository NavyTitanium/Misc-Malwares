# Artifacts on infected websites
On infected WordPress sites, the following files are always present:
```
#ls -la /home/<web user>/public_html/<website>/<infected directory>
drwxr-xr-x 2 <web user> <web user>   4096 Oct 16 03:42 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 <web user> <web user>   4096 Oct 16 16:26 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 <web user> <web user>      7 Oct 16 16:42 .2d52cebe504208dd775597d6411eaf21af00f04b
-rw-r--r-- 1 <web user> <web user>     95 Oct 16 16:43 .htaccess
-rw-r--r-- 1 <web user> <web user> 204144 Oct 16 16:43 index.php
```
The **index.php** contains the actual payload to be downloaded. It will be sent to the client after decoding it with ***gzinflate(base64_decode())***. The **.htaccess** file is also created by them, to make sure that **index.php** is the default page.

In this example, a file named **.2d52cebe504208dd775597d6411eaf21af00f04b** has been created by computing (sha1(basename(<Path on disk>))). This file simply stores the count about user-agents that downloaded the payload.

In order to be able to update the payload inside **index.php**, Emotet uses a webshell that is typically found in at least two copies within upper directories.
**xpky.php** is the current backdoor found (usually) one directory up the infected path. Note that they are now generating random webshell names between 4 and 16 characters long. The webshell is use to receive commands (identified as type 1, 2 and 3) via HTTP POST requests. 

# Webshell

They're using the popular [WSO webshell](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/php/wso/wso2.php). The password for this version is set to ***2cb00388f2110209ccb15e8ec3ab5835***

October 2019: They slightly modified the WSO WebShell and changed the password. See file **user.php** . Other file names seen includes: **link.php**, **update.php**, **menu.php**, **config.php**. They will usually leave more then 1 of them behind, in different directories, in case one gets deleted. I created a simple Python script to itterate on some paths on a Wordpress site. It looks for those backdoors. See **emotet_webshell_finder.py** 

Sometime, they will also modify the timestamp of the file, so it appears to have been created at a different date (e.g. 01-Jan-1970).

I was able to find most backdoors using those grep searches:
```
grep -lr --include=*.php "]) { exit(" /var/www/html/
grep -lr --include=*.php "php goto " /var/www/html/
grep -lr --include=*.php "*/ ?><?php function " /var/www/html/
grep -lr --include=*.php "Rst { const" /var/www/html/
grep -lr --include=*.php "methodContent = str_split(" /var/www/html/
```

January 2020: They changed their WebShell to **S.A.P. v.2.1**.

## dir.zip

Zip archive left behind by the actor. It contains PHP code with Russian comments. We can learn that the Webshell is being fetch from:

- https://pastebin.com/raw/hpqEekGT (has been seen 1289 times as of November 18th, 2019)
- https://pastebin.com/raw/kHL0XPea (has been seen 890 times as of November 18th, 2019)
- https://pastebin.com/raw/9yWezgqx (has been seen 270 times as of November 18th, 2019)


## Command type 1
Is running every ~4 mins. Returns the content of the file ***sha1(basename($contentPath))*** encoded in base64. Example:
Content of the file:
```
{"0":1294,"4":822,"2":78,"3":35,"1":18}
```
Those values represents the counts on the victims per platform (by looking at the user agent of the requestors):

| const PLATFORM | Value |
| ------------- |-------------:|
| UNKNOWN | 0 |
| ANDROID | 1 |
| APPLE | 2 |
| LINUX | 3 |
| WINDOWS | 4 |

Returned string:
```
[RST]eyIwIjoxMjk0LCI0Ijo4MjIsIjIiOjc4LCIzIjozNSwiMSI6MTh9[/RST]
```
## Command type 2
Is running every ~5 mins. Updates the ***.htaccess*** and the ***index.php*** files that contains the payload. Returns the status of the operation in base64. Example:
```
[RST]eyJzdGF0dXMiOi0xfQ==[/RST]
```
Because the WebShell run the commands being sent right away, they don't have to let any IPs related to the actual C2 in a file on disk.

## Who's sending those POST queries ?
Hosts issuing POST queries to infected WordPress are also infected. Emotet actors have root privileges on those servers, allowing them to launch [3proxy](https://github.com/z3APA3A/3proxy). On those infected machines, Nginx opens port 31181 and 31182 to allow the attacker to proxy requests. Proxy authentication is expected on port 31182. Port 31181 provides a SOCK proxy. See their [3proxy configuration](https://github.com/NavyTitanium/Misc-Malwares/blob/master/Emotet/3proxy-setup.md).

All POST queries seen had this user agent set: **Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0**.

The header of the requests also contains **X-HTTPS : 1**, which makes me believe that the requesting hosts are only serving as proxies.

```
